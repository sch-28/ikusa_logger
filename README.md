Visualize your captured logs with this [website](https://github.com/sch-28/ikusa).
## Prerequisites
- [Npcap - 1.7.8](https://npcap.com/dist/)
- [Node.js - 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Python - 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- (optional) [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have the prerequisites installed (Node.js and Python)
3. Run `build.bat`

## Usage
1. Start `ikusa-logger-win_x64.exe` located in `/dist/ikusa-logger/`
2. Click on the `Record` button
3. After you are done recording, make sure to order the names of the players in the correct order! (This is important for the website to work correctly)
The order should be: Family-Name-1 kills/died to Family-Name-2 from Enemy-Guild
4. Download the logs by clicking `Save` or upload the logs directly to the website by clicking `Upload`

If you noticed that you have chosen the wrong name order, you can open the `.log` file again with the logger and adjust the names.
